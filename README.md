 Embedded Computing in Engineering Design
 
I took this class during the summer of 2021. 

In this class, I learned that embedded computers are everywhere in modern life. On any given day we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security system, and so on. In this course, I was introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. 
I learned how to solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. I learned the hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design.
